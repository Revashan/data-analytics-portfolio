# Credit Risk & Loan Default Analysis – Retail Banking

## Project Overview
Credit risk is one of the most critical functions in retail banking.
This project analyzes loan applicant data to identify key default drivers, assess portfolio risk, and propose strategies to reduce Non-Performing Loans (NPLs).

The analysis simulates a real-world credit risk assessment requested by Risk Management and Credit Policy teams.

## Business Problem
The bank has observed an increase in loan defaults, especially among certain customer segments.
Management wants to understand:
- Which customers are most likely to default
- What factors drive default risk
- How credit policies can be refined without reducing loan approvals

---

## Objectives
- Identify high-risk borrower segments
- Analyze default drivers (income, loan amount, tenure, credit history)
- Quantify portfolio-level default exposure
- Recommend risk mitigation strategies

---

## Dataset
- Loan Default Dataset (Retail Banking / Lending)
- ~100,000 loan records
- Includes customer demographics, income, loan attributes, and default flag

Key fields:
- ApplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Term
- Credit_History
- Employment_Type
- Default_Flag

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL
- Power BI
- GitHub (Documentation)

---

## Key Metrics
- Default Rate (%)
- Exposure at Risk
- Average Loan Amount (Defaulted vs Non-Defaulted)
- Risk Segment Distribution

---

## Analysis Summary
- Default rate analysis by income, credit history, and employment
- Identification of high-risk loan profiles
- Portfolio exposure concentration analysis

---

## Deliverables
- Python notebook for EDA
- SQL scripts for risk analysis
- Power BI dashboard for credit monitoring
- Risk mitigation recommendations

---

## Outcome
This project provides a data-driven foundation for improving credit policy and reducing loan default risk.
